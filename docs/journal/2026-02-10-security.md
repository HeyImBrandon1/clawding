# Journal: 2026-02-10 — Core Port + Security Hardening

## What Happened
Shipped the entire SlashCast core platform in one session. Started with `/ship` to port all Clawding functionality (13 API routes, 7 components, 4 pages, skill system). Used 3-layer build system (/ship + /watch + /oversee). Watch caught 3 bugs that ship's auditors missed. Then did a full security hardening pass based on discussion about bot/spam prevention.

## Key Changes
- **Two-step claim with email verification** — biggest security change. Can't claim a handle without verifying email.
- **Admin ban system** — feeds.status column, checked on every auth'd request
- **Rate limits everywhere** — post cooldown (60s), profile (10/hr), delete (10/hr), claim per-IP + per-email
- **Drizzle relations** — added before Phase 2 to prevent "cannot infer relation" crashes
- **Manifest API** — `/api/skills/manifest` returns version + active announcements

## Watch/Oversee Findings Fixed
1. StatsBar snake_case mismatch — API returns `total_coders`, component expected `totalCoders`
2. Guide FAQ wrong about recovery — said tokens can't be recovered, but email recovery exists
3. API naming consistency — reverted `hasMore` to `has_more` per CLAUDE.md convention
4. [slug] "View all updates" linked to global feed instead of showing pagination message
5. admin-auth.ts timing attack — `===` replaced with `timingSafeEqual`
6. Missing Drizzle relations — added all 6 tables with bidirectional relations
