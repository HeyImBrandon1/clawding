## Summary
Planned and scaffolded SlashCast — a rebrand and major expansion of Clawding into a cross-platform, terminal-native coding community platform with events, hackathons, and live notifications.

## Accomplished
- [x] Reviewed entire Clawding codebase (frontend, API, schema, skill system, install script)
- [x] Designed v2 feature expansion (events, hackathons, shared projects, self-updating skills, shell notifications)
- [x] Discovered SKILL.md is a cross-platform standard (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cline all use it)
- [x] Designed three-layer architecture: shell hook (push) + CLI (interaction) + AI skill adapters (intelligence)
- [x] Chose name: **SlashCast** — "Broadcast What You Build", command: `/cast`
- [x] Ran full `/plan` workflow — vision, features, data model (6 tables), user flows, build order
- [x] Saved plan to `docs/plans/app-plan.md`
- [x] Secured domain (user handled)
- [x] Created GitHub org: `github.com/Slashcast` (Free plan, open source, personal account)
- [x] Verified `/cast` has no conflicts across Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline
- [x] Verified `slashcast` GitHub username/org was available
- [x] Ran `/new-project` — scaffolded full project at `~/Desktop/apps/slashcast`
- [x] Created 25 files, 2,922 lines — build passes clean
- [x] Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/Slashcast/slashcast
- [ ] Core API endpoints (13 routes from Clawding) — not started
- [ ] Core pages (homepage, user feed, guide, global feed) — placeholders only
- [ ] Event system — schema ready, no API or pages yet
- [ ] Skill content (`/cast` SKILL.md) — not written yet
- [ ] Install script — not written yet

## Workers Spawned
- **Explore agent**: Thoroughly explored Clawding frontend (all pages, components, styling, design tokens)
- **Research agent (sonnet)**: Researched AI coding tool skill/plugin systems (Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, Windsurf, Aider, Continue)
- **Research agent (sonnet)**: Checked `/cast` command conflicts across all major IDEs
- **Research agent (haiku)**: Researched Next.js 16 structure, dev community platforms, Drizzle+Neon patterns

## Files Changed (SlashCast project)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Full development framework (architecture, patterns, conventions, feature skeleton)
- `docs/plans/app-plan.md` — Complete feature roadmap, data model, build order
- `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` — Current state, schema overview, API route list, roadmap
- `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — 6 Drizzle tables (feeds, updates, events, event_participants, votes, announcements)
- `src/lib/db/index.ts` — Neon + Drizzle client
- `src/lib/auth.ts` — Feed token authentication (Bearer + bcrypt)
- `src/lib/admin-auth.ts` — Admin token authentication (ADMIN_TOKEN env var)
- `src/lib/utils.ts` — Token gen, slug validation, sanitization, colors, suggestions
- `src/lib/api-utils.ts` — ApiError, rate limiting (Upstash + in-memory fallback), JSON parsing
- `src/lib/email.ts` — Resend integration for SlashCast
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Root layout with Space Grotesk + Inter + JetBrains Mono, dark theme
- `src/app/globals.css` — Dark palette, coral+cyan accents, Tailwind v4 theme tokens
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Homepage placeholder with `/` hero and install command
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` — Working health check endpoint
- `next.config.ts` — Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- `drizzle.config.ts` — Drizzle kit config pointing to Neon
- `.env.example` — All env vars documented
- `.gitignore` — Updated to protect .env.local

## Key Decisions
- **Name: SlashCast** — "Cast" = broadcast, podcast, action verb. Not a Claude pun, works cross-platform. `/cast` as command.
- **Logo: `/` mark** — Minimal, universal. The slash IS the brand. User will handle logo design separately (DALL-E/GPT).
- **Open source** — Code is public on GitHub. Community contributions, trust for curl|bash install, hackathon meta-play.
- **GitHub org: Slashcast** — Own org (not under personal or LateNightApps). Free plan, upgrade later.
- **Dark theme kept** — Same coral (#ff6b6b) + cyan (#00e5cc) palette from Clawding. Devs code in dark mode.
- **src/ directory** — For open source professionalism. Clean root, all code in src/.
- **Same tech stack as Clawding** — Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, Drizzle, Neon, Upstash, Resend, bcryptjs. No shadcn/ui.
- **Token-based auth (no NextAuth)** — Users get tokens via CLI, stored in `~/.config/slashcast.json`.
- **Admin via API only** — No admin dashboard. Events/announcements managed via ADMIN_TOKEN bearer auth.
- **Self-updating skills via manifest** — `/api/skills/manifest` returns version, active files, announcements. Skill checks on each `/cast` run (1hr cooldown).
- **Shell notification hook** — Opt-in during install. Checks `/api/notify` on terminal open. Platform-agnostic push channel.
- **Voting via web** — CLI generates signed voting link → opens browser → vote on website. Not terminal-only.
- **Shared projects = Later** — Not MVP. First hackathon is individual entries.
- **Multi-IDE = Later** — Build for Claude Code first. Other tools are just install script tweaks.
- **Event categories** — slashcast (platform), skills (Claude skills), general (open)
- **Event lifecycle** — announced → active → ended → archived (auto-transitions based on timestamps)

## Current State
- **Build:** Passes clean (`npm run build` — 0 errors)
- **GitHub:** Live at https://github.com/Slashcast/slashcast
- **Schema:** All 6 tables defined in Drizzle, not pushed to DB yet (no DATABASE_URL)
- **API:** Only health endpoint working. 20+ route directories created but empty.
- **Pages:** Homepage placeholder only. User feed, global feed, guide, events pages not built.
- **Skill:** Not written yet (skill-content.ts doesn't exist)
- **Install script:** Not written yet (i/route.ts doesn't exist)
- **Components:** Directory exists, no components created yet

## Next Steps
1. **Set up `.env.local`** — Neon database, Upstash Redis, Resend API key, ADMIN_TOKEN
2. **Push schema** — `npx drizzle-kit push` to create all 6 tables
3. **Port core API** — 13 endpoints from Clawding (check, claim, post, delete, profile, feed, global, stats, active, discover, recover, recover/verify)
4. **Build core pages** — Homepage with real data, user feed, global feed, guide
5. **Port components** — UpdateCard, InstallCommand, StatsBar, ActiveCoders, DiscoverProfiles, ProjectFilter, RelativeTime
6. **Write `/cast` skill content** — Rewrite from Clawding skill for SlashCast branding + manifest check
7. **Write install script** — Multi-skill install, shell hook opt-in, manifest-aware
8. **Build event API** — CRUD, participation, leaderboard endpoints
9. **Build event pages** — Event list, event detail with timeline + leaderboard
10. **Build manifest + announcements API** — Self-updating skill system
11. **Build notification endpoint** — Shell hook checks `/api/notify`

## Open Questions
- [ ] Exact domain (user secured one but didn't confirm which TLD — .dev, .app, or .io)
- [ ] Accent color palette — keep coral+cyan from Clawding or pick new colors?
- [ ] Event category exact naming (slashcast/skills/general vs other labels)
- [ ] Clawding user migration strategy (redirect? import feeds?)
- [ ] Logo design — user mentioned DALL-E/GPT for the `/` mark

## Blockers
- **No `.env.local` yet** — Can't push schema or test API endpoints until Neon/Upstash/Resend credentials are configured
- **Domain not confirmed** — Email templates and skill content reference `slashcast.dev` but the actual domain hasn't been confirmed

**To continue this work:** Read this file and pick up from "Next Steps". Run `/ship` or `/go` to build Phase 1 features (core API + pages).
